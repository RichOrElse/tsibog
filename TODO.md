# TODO

Tsibog is first and foremost a platform we can use as a community for improving our Ruby practice.

Here are several ways we can work on it:

* Study how to build a Ruby app with a CLI using Thor (guide: https://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md)

* Study BDD for command-line apps using Aruba (see https://rubygems.org/gems/aruba)

* Put this into a stand-alone gem. This is a perfect playground for studying how to encapsulate business logic into a gem. (guide: https://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md)

* Study how to encapsulate different content downloads using different classes (guides: http://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2014/9/9/shape-at-the-bottom-of-all-things, http://poodr.com)

* Create a RubyMotion template app and integrate tsibog into that template

* Integrate tsibog into a Rails application
